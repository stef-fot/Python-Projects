Query Evaluation on Complex Data

This project focuses on evaluating queries on complex data, implementing operations such as grouping with aggregate functions, natural join, and composite queries. The implementation reads two CSV files (R.csv and S.csv) simultaneously, producing results efficiently without requiring a full read of the files.

Features

Grouping with Aggregate Functions: Computes grouped results with functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.

Natural Join: Performs an efficient natural join between two datasets.

Composite Queries: Executes multi-step queries with optimized processing.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Any additional required libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
